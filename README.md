# MediTrack medication tracking application

MediTrack project implemented in Flutter. The project consists of developing a mobile application to keep medication inventory
in order to enable better usage and tracking of medication for patients who struggle to keep
up with their medications and medication intake.

We know medications have a lot of information and adding all of them can be
problematic. Because of this, besides adding this information manually, users have an option
to use barcodes and QR codes which exist on the box of the medication.

Additionally while adding a medication to inventory, users need to set intake
information about it. By using this information, MediTrack notifies users about
intake time of the medication and warns users when there is a problem related to the amount
of medication left. At the end users are able to see a summary of their usage and history. In
addition, we deliver information about the pandemic that started in 2020. The
pandemic tracker includes numbers of cases, active cases, deaths and people who have
recovered. Furthermore, our application plays a role like an information bank. In this
perspective, in addition to medications and covid-19 data, the pharmacy information is
available. According to their location, users are able to display pharmacies on duty, which is
closest to their location.
